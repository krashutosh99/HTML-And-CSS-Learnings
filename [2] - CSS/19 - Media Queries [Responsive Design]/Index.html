  <!--                                      Media Queries [For Responsive Design]

          The @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to [define different style rules] for  [different media types].
            Media queries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they look at the capability of the device.

            Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:
              -> width and height of the viewport
              -> orientation of the viewport (landscape or portrait)
              -> resolution
            Using media queries is a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet for desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.

            [ CSS Media Types ] 
               [Value] 	    [Description]
                all 	     Used for all media type devices
                print 	     Used for print preview mode
                screen 	     Used for computer screens, tablets, smart-phones etc.

            [ Media Query Syntax ]

             A media query consists of a "media type" and can contain "one or more media features", which resolve to either true or false. 
            
                @media not|only mediatype and (media feature) and (media feature) {
                      CSS-Code;
                }

            The mediatype is optional (if omitted, it will be set to all). However, if you use not or only, you must also specify a mediatype.
