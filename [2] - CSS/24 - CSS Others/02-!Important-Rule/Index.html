  <!--                             CSS !Important Rule

        What is !important Rule ?

        The !important rule in CSS is used to add more importance to a property/value than normal.
        In fact, if you use the !important rule, it will override ALL previous styling rules for that specific property on that element!

  <!-- [Tip]: It is good to know about the !important rule. You might see it in some CSS source code.     However, do not use it unless you absolutely have to. -->
