  <!--                                 CSS Units

    CSS has several different units for expressing a length. CSS units define the size of elements, with absolute units (like px, cm) having fixed values and relative units (like em, rem, %, vh) depending on factors like the viewport or parent elements. 

    Many CSS properties take "length" values, such as width, margin, padding, font-size, etc.

      Length is a number followed by a length unit, such as 10px, 2em, etc.

        Example ----

          [a.] h1 {
               font-size: 60px;
              }

          [b.] p {
                font-size: 25px;
                line-height: 50px;
              } 

        There are two types of length units : Absolute and Relative Units ------

          [1.] Absolute Lengths ---- The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of units will appear as exactly that size.

            Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen, because screen sizes vary so much. However, they can be used if the output medium is known, such as for print layout.

              [Unit]	    [Description]
                cm 	         centimeters
                mm 	         millimeters
                in 	         inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm) 
                px * 	       pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)
                pt 	         points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)
                pc 	         picas (1pc = 12 pt)

            [Note] --- * Pixels (px) are relative to the viewing device. For low-dpi devices, 1px is one device pixel (dot) of the display. For printers and high resolution screens 1px implies multiple device pixels.


          [2.] Relative Lengths ----- Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative length units scale better between different rendering mediums.

            [Unit] 	 [Description]
              em       Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font) 		
              rem 	   Relative to font-size of the root element 	
              vw 	     Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport* 	
              vh 	     Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport* 	
              % 	     Relative to the parent element 	

            Tip: The em and rem units are practical in creating perfectly scalable layout!
            * Viewport = the browser window size. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw = 0.5cm.
