  <!--                                             CSS Comments

    Comments are used to explain the code, and may help when you edit the source code at a later date. Comments are ignored by browsers.

    A CSS comment is placed inside the <style> element, and starts with /* and ends with */ :

      Example -----

        [1.]  /* This is a single-line comment */

          p {
            color: red;
          } 

        [2.]  You can add comments wherever you want in the code:

          p {
            color: red;  /* Set text color to red */
          } 

          Even in the middle of a code line:
          p {
            color: /*red*/blue; 
          } 
                 
        [3.] Comments can also span multiple lines: ------

          /* This is
            a multi-line
            comment 

            p {
              color: red;
            }
                          
          */
